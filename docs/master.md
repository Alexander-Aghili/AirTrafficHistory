This is the master file for things to fix and for organization. Why, you might ask, am I doing a master.txt file? 
I don't know... helps me prioritize I hope but if it doesn't work Ill fix later.


TODO section. This keeps track of all TODO comments in the code to avoid forgetting about things I have marked to do.
It also acts as a list of things I need to implement
TODO is formatted as follows: (File, Method(*), Comment, Notes/Summarization**)

* Doesn't indicate parameters, only use parenthesis to indicate that it is a method name.
**Maybe blank

TODO:
 1. GetTraffic, getElapsedAreaData(), Catch error, Catch error for errors relating to Opensky response for both this method and the AircraftElapsedData method above
 2. AirTrafficHistoryService, getHistory(), Finish, 
 3. Aircraft, toJson(), better naming for the shit in this method, Do this for other json methods as well
 4. ModelListToJson, aircraftListToJson(), implement,
 5. ModelListToJson, aircraftDataListToJson(), implement,
 6. AircraftData, toJson(), decide if toJson needs to happen or if toJsonArray will work (Based on if REST API can send array back in order),

 
 
 Other Notes:
 It is currently 2:07 AM on a school night so I kinda screwed myself :)
 Worth it
